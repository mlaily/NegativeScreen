Description:

NegativeScreen's main goal is to support your poor tearful eyes when enjoying the bright white interweb in a dark room.
This task is joyfully achieved by inverting the colors of your screen.

Unlike the Windows Magnifier, which is also capable of such color inversion,
NegativeScreen was specifically designed to be easy and convenient to use.

It comes without any graphic interface, but dont worry, this only makes it easier to use!


Features:

Invert screen's colors :)


Useful controls:

-Press Win+Alt+H to Halt the program immediately
-Press Win+Alt+N to toggle color inversion (mnemonic: Night vision :))
-Press Win+Alt+Add to increase the refresh timer
	(go easier on the CPU and the GPU, but if set too high, can lead to annoying stuttering)
-Press Win+Alt+Substract to decrease the refresh timer
-Press Win+Alt+Multiply to Reset the timer to its default value

Default constants:
Increase/Decrease: +/-10ms
Reset timer: 10ms


Enjoy!
